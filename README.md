# wine-quality-prediction
This repository contains the algorithm for analysis on wine quality prediction. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to provide valuable insights into the factors that influence wine quality and to predict wine quality scores with a high degree of accuracy.
#Models used
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
The scores for both the models were evaluated and these models can be used to calculate the quality of wine based on their features.
